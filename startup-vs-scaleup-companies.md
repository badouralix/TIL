# Startup vs. Scaleup Companies

This fun fact is the outcome of an enlightening discussion with friends.

## Fun Fact

The notion of startup is fairly well spread out nowadays. In a nutshell, it is an early-staged company still in the process of identify a viable business model.

But little is known about scaleups, which is a common-but-not-so-common denomination for startups which made it. At this point, the business model problematic is solved, and the company showed a consistent exponential growth.

Check out this [Google Trends link](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F012962sm,%2Fm%2F0h01f), maybe scaleup usage will eventually scale up :crossed_fingers:
