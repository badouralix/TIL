# Github Ghost Account

## Fun fact

[@ghost](https://github.com/ghost) is a github user that gets associated with
all comments, issues and pull requests created by a human user after the account
is deleted. That way, the account can be cascade deleted without losing any
history nor community knowledge.

As of today, it has over 2k followers.
